To build the code just build it normally with Eclipse + Android tools.
Rename the file Key.java.public in WLANAudit/src/es/glasspixel/wlanaudit/ads
to Key.java to build the application.

To build from eclipse, you have to import to the workspace the submodule projects.

To build from command line with ant, you have to run android update project command
at each submodule directory to generate the appropiate buildfiles.
