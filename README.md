WLANAudit 3
===========
An application to scan for WLAN Access points and to audit their security and capabilities
The application shows relevant diagnostic information about an access point such as MAC Address, encryption, signal strength, etc.

On some access points the application tries to guess the access point default password via if a public known algorithm exists.

This app is **NOT MEANT** to be used as a hacking utility, so I'm not responsible of the usage you make of it.

Getting the sourcecode
======================
To get the source code clone the repository with the following commands
    
    $ git clone git://github.com/RobertoEstrada/WLANAudit-Android.git

Once clone has finished
    
    $ git submodule update --init

Building the sourcecode
=======================
In order to build the sourcecode you need to have installed and configured Java, the Android SDK and Apache Ant. You need to set the environment variable ANDROID_HOME and have the Android tools and Ant in your path.

Then in a shell at the project root, use the following command

    $ ant build-debug

Working with Eclipse
====================
In a shell at the project root, use the following command to generate eclipse project files for all the dependencies.

    $ ant eclipse 

When done, open eclipse and select *File / Import / Existing projects into workspace* and then select the project root as the base directory. Select all the projects except those that have *'Sample'* on their names.

Work as usual.
